I offer statistical consulting services to academia, government, NGOs and independent researchers.

I have particular expertise in:

- Sample size calculations, including calculation by simulation
- The design and analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys
- Design of individual and cluster randomised controlled trials
- Design and analysis of cross-over trials
- Causal inference methods
- Machine learning for predictive modelling

I also offer training in statistical analysis, either 1-on-1 or via workshops.

If you have need of advice or expertise in designing or analysing research, please contact me via email to discuss your needs.
