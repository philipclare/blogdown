abstract: 'Background and Aims: Studies have linked adolescent alcohol use with adverse
  consequences in adulthood, yet it is unclear how strong the associations are and
  to what extent they may be due to confounding. Our aim was to estimate the strength
  of association between different patterns of adolescent drinking and longer-term
  psychosocial harms taking into account individual, family and peer factors. Design:
  Participant-level data were integrated from four long-running longitudinal studies:
  Australian Temperament Project, Christchurch Health and Development Study, Mater
  Hospital and University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy and Victorian Adolescent
  Health Cohort Study. Setting: Australia and New Zealand. Participants: Participants
  were assessed on multiple occasions between ages 13 and 30 years (from 1991 to 2012).
  Number of participants varied (up to n = 9453) by analysis. Measurements: Three
  patterns of alcohol use (frequent, heavy episodic and problem drinking) were assessed
  prior to age 17. Thirty outcomes were assessed to age 30 spanning substance use
  and related problems, antisocial behaviour, sexual risk-taking, accidents, socio-economic
  functioning, mental health and partner relationships. Findings: After covariate
  adjustment, weekly drinking prior to age 17 was associated with a two- to threefold
  increase in the odds of binge drinking [odds ratio (OR) = 2.14; 95% confidence interval
  (CI) = 1.57–2.90], drink driving (OR = 2.78; 95% CI = 1.84–4.19), alcohol-related
  problems (OR = 3.04; 95% CI = 1.90–4.84) and alcohol dependence (OR = 3.30; 95%
  CI = 1.69–6.47) in adulthood. Frequency of drinking accounted for a greater proportion
  of the rate of most adverse outcomes than the other measures of alcohol use. Associations
  between frequent, heavy episodic and problem drinking in adolescence and most non-alcohol
  outcomes were largely explained by shared risk factors for adolescent alcohol use
  and poor psychosocial functioning. Conclusions: Frequency of adolescent drinking
  predicts substance use problems in adulthood as much as, and possibly more than,
  heavy episodic and problem drinking independent of individual, family and peer predictors
  of those outcomes. © 2018 Society for the Study of Addiction'
