abstract: "Background: Methamphetamine (MA) use disorder is a new health problem among
  female methadone patients in Iran. Some characteristics of women are likely to be
  associated with poor methadone treatment outcomes. However, there are few studies
  about the characteristics of this group. Objectives: The current study is the first
  research that aimed to investigate the demographic, drug use and treatment characteristics
  of a group of regular MA-using women in methadone treatment. Methods: Methadone-maintained
  women who reported at least weekly MA use were recruited from four methadone treatment
  centres in Tehran. Participants' drug use, severity of MA dependence, psychiatric
  distress, social functioning, criminality and high risk sexual behaviours were measured
  among the participants. Urinalysis was done to confirm MA use. Results: Between
  28 July 2014 and 15 May 2015, 120 participants completed an interview. Mean duration
  of MA use was 5.4 (SD 2.1) years. Only 9.2% of the participants reported prior MA
  treatment. Psychiatric distress was high among all participants. Overall, 61 participants
  (50.8%) reported long duration of MA use (i.e. five years or more) while 59 participants
  (49.2%) reported less than five years of MA use. Severity of MA dependence (P =
  0.38), psychiatric distress (P = 0.36), social functioning (P = 0.12) and criminality
  (P = 0.82) were not significantly associated with duration of MA use. However, participants
  who reported long duration of MAuse were more likely to be engaged in high risk
  sexual behaviours (P = 0.01) compared with those reporting short duration of MA
  use. Conclusions: The study results indicated that participants had multiple health
  problems. High risk sexual behaviours were considerable among participants with
  long duration of MA use despite being in methadone treatment. Participants had little
  or no previous treatment for MA use disorder. Treatment services should be expanded
  to address MA use disorder and its harms among this group. Â© 2017, Mazandaran University
