abstract: "Background: Financial stress is a barrier to successful smoking cessation
  and a key predictor of relapse. Little is known about the financial situation of
  low-income Australian daily smokers. This study aims to describe and investigate
  associations between the financial functioning, tobacco use and quitting behaviours
  of low income daily smokers. Methods: Low-income Australian adult smokers in the
  'Financial Intervention for Smoking Cessation Among Low-income Smokers (FISCALS)
  randomised clinical trial completed a structured telephone questionnaire. Results:
  The median number of cigarettes typically smoked by the 1047 participants was 23
  per day. The median spent on tobacco per week was AU$80. Three quarters (73.0%)
  reported some financial stress and 43.2% reported smoking-induced deprivation. Financial
  stress was significantly associated with deprivation (IRR: 1.23, 95% CI 1.21, 1.26,
  p < 0.001). There were no significant associations either between adjusted financial
  stress or deprivation and motivation to quit or certainty of quit success. Conclusions:
  Financial stress and smoking induced deprivation were prevalent among low-income
  daily smokers, but they were not associated with motivation to quit. Smoking cessation
  interventions need to be responsive to the role financial stress plays in reducing
  quit attempts and increasing relapse. Trial registration: Australian and New Zealand
