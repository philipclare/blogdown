abstract: 'Background: Poor social wellbeing is associated with health risks and excessive
  health care use. Identifying individuals at risk for poor social wellbeing and providing
  them with social care may improve their wellbeing, and also reduce costs from unnecessary
  health care utilization. Psychosocial interventions have been suggested to contribute
  to decreased health care use, however, such evidence has not been systematically
  quantified or synthesized. Objective: To systematically examine and meta-analyze
  all available evidence on the effect of psychosocial interventions on health care
  utilization. Methods: The databases Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Cochrane
  and Scopus were searched in May 2021. Studies were included if they were randomised
  controlled trials that reported on health care utilisation and social wellbeing
  outcomes. A multi-level meta-analysis was used to derive pooled effects of interventions.
  Sub-group analyses examined participant- and intervention-level characteristics
  associated with intervention effects. Findings: Twenty-nine studies were included
  from 14,622 citations; 25 were eligible for meta-analysis. Data were analysed across
  6357 participants, including older adults, post-natal women, people with chronic
  illnesses and caregivers. The overall effect was in favor of the intervention group,
  with 28% reduction in health care utilization [OR = 0.68; 95%CI = 0.48, 0.94]. Decreases
  in the use of emergency care, primary care and inpatient care were found. An improvement
  was observed in social support [SMD = 0.32; 95%CI = 0.04, 0.61]. Short (< 6 months),
  one-on-one interventions delivered by health professionals and interventions targeting
  caregivers had more favourable health care utilisation outcomes. A sustained reduction
  in inpatient care was observed for 6-12 months post-intervention. Conclusions: There
  is evidence that psychosocial interventions have the potential to reduce the burden
  on the health care system. Participant and intervention delivery characteristics,
  as well as intervention duration, could potentially affect outcomes and should be
  considered when designing and implementing future interventions. Â© (2023), (European
