abstract: In Australia, one in three people are born overseas, and one in five households
  speak languages other than English. This study explores substance use prevalence,
  related harms, and attitudes among these large groups in the population. Analysis
  was conducted using cross-sectional data (N = 22, 696) from the 2013 National Drug
  Strategy Household Survey. General linear model and binary logistic regression were
  used to assess substance use and harms, using stabilized inverse propensity score
  weighting to control for potential confounding variables. Between culturally and
  linguistically diverse populations and the population born in Australia, United
  Kingdom, or New Zealand who speak only English at home, there is no statistically
  significant variation in the likelihood of current smoking; using analgesics, tranquilizers,
  or sleeping pills; or administering drugs via injection. Culturally diverse populations
  are less likely to drink alcohol or use cannabis or methamphetamines. No difference
  between these two major groups in the population is observed in substance-related
  abuse from strangers; but culturally diverse respondents are less likely to report
  substance-related abuse from known persons. Lower substance use prevalence is not
  observed among people from culturally diverse backgrounds who have mental health
  issues. Australian-, UK-, or New Zealand–born respondents who speak only English
  at home are more likely to oppose drug and tobacco policies, including a range of
  harm reduction policies. We discuss the practical and ethical limitations of this
  major Australian data set for examining the burden of drug-related harms experienced
  by specific migrant populations. Avenues for potential future research are outlined.
