abstract: 'Background: Recent research has not supported the idea that parental supply
  of alcohol to adolescents prevents later alcohol-related harm. Yet the specific
  role of parental supply in shaping patterns of drinking over time remains unclear.
  This study investigated the role of parental supply of alcohol in patterns of drinking
  across adolescence, and assessed whether that role remained consistent over time.
  Method: Using a longitudinal cohort of 1927 adolescents (mean age 12.9 years), recruited
  in 2010 and 2011 from schools across Australia and followed up annually until 2016,
  we assessed three outcomes using mixed-effect negative binomial regression: frequency
  of consumption, typical quantity consumed, and overall alcohol consumption in the
  year (frequency * quantity). Child, parental, familial, and peer confounders of
  adolescent alcohol consumption were measured and adjusted for in the analyses. Findings:
  Parental supply was associated with greater overall consumption in earlier adolescence:
  Grade 7–8 (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 3.61; 95% CI: 2.55, 5.12; no supply IRR:
  1.00), Grade 8–9 (IRR: 4.84; 95% CI: 3.66, 6.39; no supply IRR: 1.44) and Grade
  9–10 (IRR: 8.33; 95% CI: 6.28, 11.05; no supply IRR: 4.75). Alcohol consumption
  continued to increase in later adolescence regardless of whether parental supply
  occurred. Conclusions: Parental supply of alcohol was associated with increased
  alcohol consumption by their children during early adolescence. While parental supply
  appears to have less impact on drinking in later adolescence, there was no evidence
  to suggest it is protective. Parents should be advised to avoid supplying children
  with alcohol, particularly in early adolescence. © 2019'
