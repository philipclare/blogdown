abstract: There is a lack of evidence of effective and appropriate drug and alcohol
  treatment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This paper contributes
  to addressing the evidence gap by examining the feasibility and acceptability and
  conducting a pre/post-evaluation of the Aboriginal-adapted Community Reinforcement
  Approach (CRA) delivered in New South Wales, Australia. Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal
  clients (n = 55) received tailored CRA delivery between March and November 2013.
  Compared to the original US version, tailored CRA had reduced technical language,
  reduced number of treatment sessions, and the addition of group delivery option.
  An Australian training manual with local case studies was developed. Alcohol, Smoking
  and Substance Involvement Test (ASSIST), Kessler-5 (K-5) and the Growth Empowerment
  Measure were used. 58% of participants were followed-up at 3 months. Tailored CRA
  was feasible to deliver in a rural, community-based health setting, and rated by
  clients as highly effective and acceptable. CRA was associated with statistically
  significant reductions in the use of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, amphetamine and
  over the counter medication, and levels of psychological distress, and an increase
  in levels of empowerment for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal clients. This study provides
  evidence for the feasibility and acceptability of an Aboriginal-adapted psychological
  intervention addressing drug, alcohol and mental health outcomes. © 2019 International
