abstract: 'Background: Methamphetamine dependence is a significant global health concern
  for which there are no approved medications. The cysteine prodrug, N-acetylcysteine
  (NAC), has been found to ameliorate glutamate dysregulation in addiction, and to
  reduce craving for methamphetamine and other drugs. We evaluated the efficacy and
  safety of NAC as a pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine dependence. Methods: A parallel
  double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial of people dependent on methamphetamine
  recruited from Geelong, Melbourne and Wollongong, Australia, between July 2018 and
  December 2019. Participants were randomised to receive either 12 weeks of oral NAC
  (2400 mg/day) or matched placebo, delivered as a take-home medication. The primary
  outcome was methamphetamine use, measured in two ways: (a) change in days of use
  in the past 4 weeks from baseline to weeks 4, 8 and 12, assessed using the Timeline
  Followback; and (b) methamphetamine-positive oral fluid samples taken weekly. Analyses
  were intention-to-treat and based on imputed data. Secondary outcomes were craving,
  severity of dependence, withdrawal severity and psychiatric symptoms (depression,
  suicidality, hostility and psychotic symptoms). Significance levels were p < 0.025
  for primary outcomes and p < 0.01 for secondary outcomes. Adverse events were compared
  between groups by system organ class. The study was prospectively registered, ACTRN12618000366257.
  Results: Participants (N = 153; 59% male, mean [SD] age 38 [8]) were randomised
  to placebo (n = 77) or NAC (n = 76). Both groups had a median (IQR) of 24 (15–28)
  days of methamphetamine use in the 4 weeks prior to baseline. Both groups significantly
  reduced methamphetamine use (mean [SE] reduction of 7.3 [1.2]) days for placebo,
  6.8 [1.2] for NAC) but NAC did not reduce days of methamphetamine use more than
  placebo (group difference of 0.5 days, 97.5% CI -3.4–4.3). There was no significant
  effect of NAC on methamphetamine-positive oral fluid samples (placebo 79%, NAC 76%;
  mean difference -2.6, 97.5% CI -12.6–7.4). NAC did not significantly reduce craving,
  severity of dependence, withdrawal, suicidality, depression, hostility or psychotic
  symptoms relative to placebo. Adverse events did not differ significantly between
  placebo and NAC groups. Interpretation: These findings suggest that take-home oral
  NAC has no significant effect on methamphetamine use or most clinically related
  outcomes amongst people who are dependent on the drug. © 2021'
