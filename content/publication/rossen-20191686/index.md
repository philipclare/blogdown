abstract: 'Introduction: The quality of the mother–child relationship in the first
  year of life has far reaching implications across the life course (Bornstein in
  Annu Rev Psychol 65:121–158, 2014). Yet little is known about predictors of maternal
  bonding and emotional availability in early infancy. In this study we examined the
  extent to which postnatal bonding, maternal mental health, and substance use at
  8-weeks postpartum predicted mother–infant bonding (self-report) and mother emotional
  availability (observational) at 12-months of age. Methods: Data were obtained from
  an Australian longitudinal cohort study of pregnancy (n = 308). Data were collected
  during pregnancy, at birth, and postnatally at 8-weeks and 12-months. Results: The
  results show strong continuity between postnatal bonding at 8-weeks and 12-months.
  Early postpartum stress and depression were associated with bonding at 12-months;
  however, the effect did not persist after adjustment for bonding at 8-weeks. Tobacco
  use at 8-weeks, but no other indicators of mental health, predicted lower emotional
  availability scores at 12-months. Discussion: Results suggest that the mother’s
  felt bond to her child is stable across the first year of life and that early bonding
  is a more robust indicator of bonding at 12-months than a mother’s mental health
  or substance use. These findings point to the importance of clinical and public
  health investments in establishing a strong bond between mother and child in the
  early postpartum period. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer
