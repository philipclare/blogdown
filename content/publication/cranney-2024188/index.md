abstract: "Issue addressed: There is growing evidence that online parent-focused child
  healthy lifestyle interventions can improve healthy eating practices and food environments
  in the home. Greater understanding of whether and how parents engage with these
  online interventions is needed. This study evaluated the reach, acceptability and
  impacts of an online parent healthy lifestyle intervention. Methods: A pilot study
  was conducted in New South Wales during the COVID-19 pandemic when stay-at-home
  public health orders were in place (July–August 2021). A concurrent mixed methods
  design was adopted. Data collection measures were: an online participant survey
  at baseline, post-intervention and 3-month follow-up; two online post-intervention
  focus groups; and web metrics at post-intervention and 3-month follow-up. Results:
  There were 181 intervention participants, primarily mothers with high education
  levels and living in advantaged areas: 43 (24%) completed surveys post-intervention;
  and of these, 35 (81%; 19% of participants) completed surveys at follow-up. Sixteen
  mothers participated in focus groups. Parents' knowledge, self efficacy, role modelling
  and behaviours improved, but there were no significant differences detected over
  time. Metrics and survey data indicated webinar recordings, particularly the topics
  of ‘Fussy Eating’ and ‘Screen time and sleep’, had the greatest engagement and most
  perceived them as useful (93% and 96%, respectively). Conclusions: An online healthy
  lifestyle intervention to support parents in providing opportunities for their children
  to engage in healthier lifestyle behaviours was appealing and acceptable to mothers
  and has the potential to improve families' healthy lifestyle behaviours. Enhancing
  intervention reach amongst fathers and priority populations, as well as incorporating
  design elements to enhance engagement will be important. So what?: An online healthy
  lifestyle intervention reached and engaged parents, despite being faced with additional
  parenting challenges arising from COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. © 2023 The Authors.
