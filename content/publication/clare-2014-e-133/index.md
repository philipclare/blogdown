abstract: 'Objectives This paper used national survey data to investigate ‘hardcore’
  smoking as predicted by the ‘hardening hypothesis’, and to examine the relationship
  between ‘hardcore’ smoking and socioeconomic status (SES).; Methods Analyses were
  performed using data from four waves of the Australian National Drug Strategy Household
  Survey between 2001 and 2010, a large national survey with a sample size of approximately
  24 000 participants per wave. The primary outcome variable was ‘hardcore’ smoking,
  comprised of the variables: ‘no quit attempt in past 12 months’; ‘no plan to quit’;
  and smoking more than 15 cigarettes per day. The main predictor variables used were
  SES assessed by the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA), and survey wave. Other
  sociodemographic variables were also examined.; Results Overall, ‘hardcore’ smoking
  remained stable from 2001 to 2010. However, ‘hardcore’ smoking declined among high-SES
  smokers (from 1.8% to 1.0%), but not among low-SES smokers (around 3.4%). ‘Hardcore’
  smoking was strongly associated with SEIFA quintile (p<0.001). There was a significant
  interaction effect between top and bottom SEIFA quintiles and wave (p=0.025), with
  a decline in ‘hardcore’ smoking measures over the four waves among those in the
  top two SEIFA quintiles, with odds in 2010 of 0.39 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.87; p=0.012),
  down from 0.64 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.82; p<0.001) in 2001, while ‘hardcore’ smoking
  remained stable among those in the bottom two SEIFA quintiles.; Conclusions The
  results from high SES smokers suggest ‘hardcore’ smokers are able to quit, but outcomes
  among low-SES smokers are less encouraging. © 2014 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights
