abstract: 'Importance: It has been suggested that interventions that aim to improve
  social well-being may contribute to decreased health care use; however, such evidence
  has not been fully systematically synthesized. Objective: To systematically review
  and meta-analyze available evidence on the associations between psychosocial interventions
  and health care utilization. Data Sources: Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cumulated
  Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane, Scopus, Google Scholar,
  and reference lists of systematic reviews were searched from inception until November
  31, 2022. Study Selection: Included studies were randomized clinical trials reporting
  on both health care utilization and social well-being outcomes. Data Extraction
  and Synthesis: The reporting of the systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting
  Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Full-text
  and quality assessments were conducted by 2 reviewers independently. Multilevel
  random-effects meta-analyses were used to synthesize the data. Subgroup analyses
  were conducted to examine the characteristics associated with decreased health care
  use. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome of interest was health care utilization,
  including primary, emergency, inpatient, and outpatient care services. Social well-being
  was measured as social support, social participation, social relationships, community
  support, social integration, or loneliness. Results: A total of 41 studies were
  retrieved from 18969 citations; 37 studies were eligible for meta-analysis. Data
  were analyzed for 7842 participants, including 2745 older adults, 1579 young women
  considered to be at risk of social and mental health disadvantages, 1118 people
  with chronic illnesses, 1597 people with mental illnesses, and 803 caregivers. The
  odds ratio (OR) random-effects model showed an overall reduction in health care
  use (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.97), but the standardized mean difference (SMD)
  random effect model showed no association. An improvement in health care utilization
  was observed in association with social support interventions (SMD, 0.25; 95% CI,
  0.04 to 0.45) but not in loneliness interventions. Subgroup analysis indicated a
  reduced length of inpatient visits (SMD, -0.35; 95% CI, -0.61 to -0.09) and number
  of emergency care visits (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.96) following the intervention.
  However, an increase in outpatient care associated with psychosocial interventions
  was observed (SMD, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.62). The largest reductions in health
  care use were associated with interventions among caregivers (OR, 0.23; 95% CI,
  0.07 to 0.71) and individuals with mental illnesses (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.74).
  Conclusions: These findings suggest that psychosocial interventions were associated
  with most measures of health care utilization. As the association differed by participant
  and intervention delivery characteristics, these characteristics should be considered
  in the design of future interventions.. Â© 2023 American Medical Association. All
