abstract: "Introduction and Aims: Aboriginal residential rehabilitation services provide
  healing for Aboriginal people who misuse substances. There is limited available
  research that empirically describes client characteristics of these services. This
  study examined 5 years of data of a remote Aboriginal residential rehabilitation
  service. Design and Methods: Retrospective analysis of 329 client admissions to
  Orana Haven Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre from 2011 to 2016. Multinomial
  and binary logistic regressions were conducted to identify trends in the data. Results:
  There were 66 admissions recorded annually, of which most identified as Aboriginal
  (85%). Mean length of stay was 56 days, with one in three (36%) discharging within
  the first month. A third (32%) completed, 47% self-discharged and 20% house-discharged
  from the program. Client age significantly increased over time (P = 0.03), with
  most aged from 26 to 35. Older clients were significantly more likely to readmit
  (P < 0.002) and stay longer than 90 days (P = 0.02). Most clients were referred
  from the criminal justice system, significantly increasing from 79% (2011–2012)
  to 96% (2015–2016) (P < 0.001) and these clients were more likely to self-discharge
  (P < 0.01). Among a subset of clients, most (69%) reported concerns with polysubstance
  use and half (51%) reported mental illness. Discussion and Conclusions: The current
  study makes a unique contribution to the literature by empirically describing the
  characteristics of clients of a remote Aboriginal residential rehabilitation service
  to more accurately tailor the service to the client's needs. Key recommendations
  include integrating these empirical observations with staff and client perceptions
  to co-design a model of care, standardise data collection, and routinely following-up
  clients to monitor treatment effectiveness. © 2018 The Authors Drug and Alcohol
