abstract: 'Purpose of Review: This study aimed to contribute to the debate on the
  availability of opioids for pain management by comparing regional and global trends
  for controlled strong opioids most commonly used for pain over the past 21 years.
  We conducted a series of analyses on the use of 12 opioids, with a focus on fentanyl,
  hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, and oxycodone over the 21-year period of 1995–2015,
  at a regional and global level with country-level data, using random intercept mixed
  models to assess for change over time and interactions, and controlling for country
  economic development. Recent Findings: Despite the sufficient supply of opioids
  to cover global demand, potent opioid pain medications are not available in many
  regions of the world. Prices of basic off-patent opioid formulations are significantly
  higher in poor countries as compared to lowest global prices, whilst countries may
  be under pressure to acquire expensive formulations. This results in lower availability
  of opioids for pain management in lower-income countries. Summary: The analysis
  shows that, when adjusted for country-level gross domestic product (GDP) per capita
  and Human Development Index (HDI) category, the most significant trends in opioid
  consumption for pain management are those of morphine and fentanyl. Whilst the trend
  for use of morphine has remained relatively stable, fentanyl use has risen sharply
  in the past 21 years, even in regions where the levels of overall opioid availability
  are inadequate or very inadequate. The trends vary according to different regions
  of the world. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.'
