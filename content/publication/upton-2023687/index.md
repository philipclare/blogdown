abstract: 'Background Young people may have elevated risk for poorer mental health
  during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, yet longitudinal studies
  documenting this impact are lacking. This study assessed changes in mental health
  and help-seeking since COVID-19 restrictions in young Australians, including gender
  differences. Methods Data were drawn from a recent subsample (n = 443; 60% female;
  Mage = 22.0) of a prospective cohort originally recruited in secondary school to
  complete annual surveys. The subsample completed an additional COVID-19 survey during
  COVID-19 restrictions (May-June 2020), which was compared to responses from their
  latest annual survey (August 2019-March 2020). Mixed effect models with time and
  gender as the primary predictors were conducted for: (i) scores on the Patient Health
  Questionnaire Depression 9-item (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item
  (GAD-7) modules assessed before and during COVID-19 restrictions, and (ii) self-reported
  help-seeking from a health professional in February 2020, and the month preceding
  May-June 2020. Results Mean symptom scores increased from before to during COVID-19
  restrictions on the PHQ-9 (coefficient: 1.29; 95% CI 0.72-1.86) and GAD-7 (0.78;
  95% CI 0.26-1.31), but there was no increase in help-seeking over time (odds ratio
  0.50; 95% CI 0.19-1.32). There was no evidence of differential changes by gender.
  Conclusions This study found increases in depression and anxiety symptoms but not
  greater help-seeking among young Australian adults during the first wave of the
  pandemic. Increasing availability and awareness of accessible treatment options
  and psychoeducation is critical, as well as further research into risk and protective
  factors to help target treatment to this vulnerable age group.  Copyright Â© The
