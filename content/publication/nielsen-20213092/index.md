abstract: 'Aims: Pregabalin has become widely used as an alternative to opioids in
  treating certain types of chronic non-cancer pain, but few studies have examined
  its clinical efficacy outside trials. We address this gap by examining the utilization,
  correlates and clinical outcomes of pregabalin use among an Australian community-based
  cohort of people prescribed opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Methods: Through
  a five-year prospective cohort study (n = 1514) we examined associations between
  pregabalin use and pain severity and interference, mental health, opioid dose and
  past month use of ambulance and emergency department services. We used fixed-effects
  regression models to examine within-participant differences, and random-effects
  regression models to examine within- and between-participant differences in clinical
  outcomes. Results: In an analysis of cases with complete data over five-years (n
  = 896), the prevalence of pregabalin use ranged from 16% at cohort entry to 29%
  at 36- and 48-months, and 46% reported pregabalin use at any time during the five
  years. Pregabalin use was associated with greater pain severity and interference
  and greater use of high-risk opioid doses (>90 oral morphine equivalents/day). Pregabalin
  use was not associated with changes in mental health symptoms, ambulance or emergency
  department attendance in the fixed or random effects models. Conclusions: Pregabalin
  use was common, but for most people use was not associated with clinically meaningful
  improvements in pain or functioning. Â© 2020 British Pharmacological Society.'
