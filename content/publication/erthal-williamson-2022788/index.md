abstract: 'Background Pharmaceutical opioid consumption has been increasing worldwide,
  but disparities in access to these medications exist. Few countries of the WHO Eastern
  Mediterranean Region have well defined pain management policies. Aims This study
  presents trends in the consumption of pharmaceutical opioids in the 22 countries
  in the Eastern Mediterranean Region from 2010 to 2019, with comparative intra-and
  extra-regional analyses; the correlation between pharmaceutical opioid consumption
  and human development index rankings; and pharmaceutical opioids use in the region.
  Methods We calculated the defined daily doses for statistical purposes (S-DDD) per
  million inhabitants per day of pharmaceutical opioids from 2010 to 2019, and used
  the mixed effects models to assess changes in consumption. We used regression analyses
  to establish the strength of associations between human development index level
  and consumption in the region and elsewhere. Results Pharmaceutical opioid use has
  fluctuated in the region since 2010, with a mean sum of S-DDD of 2547 for 2010–
  2019. Consumption is relatively low in the region irrespective of the human development
  index. The highest-consuming country reported 369 S-DDD in 2019 and the lowest reported
  1 S-DDD. The most used pharmaceutical opioids in the region were fentanyl, morphine,
  pethidine, oxycodone, and codeine. Conclusion Consumption could be considered inadequate
  in several countries of the region. Supporting these countries to improve collection
  and reporting of consumption data, and providing humanitarian assistance to enhance
  access to pain relief, should be a priority for the international community. © Authors
