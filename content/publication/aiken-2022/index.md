abstract: 'Background: Supply of alcohol to adolescents is associated with increased
  alcohol consumption and harms including alcohol use disorder (AUD). We aimed to
  identify: (1) trajectories of alcohol supply to adolescents; (2) sociodemographic
  characteristics associated with supply trajectory; (3) patterns of alcohol consumption
  by supply trajectory; and (4) supply trajectory associations with adverse alcohol
  outcomes. Methods: We used Australian longitudinal survey data (N = 1813) to model
  latent trajectories of parent and peer alcohol supply over five annual follow-ups
  (Waves 2–6; Mage 13.9–17.8 years). Regression models assessed associations between
  supply trajectories and Wave 1 (Mage=12.9 years) sociodemographic factors and associations
  between supply trajectories and Wave 7 (Mage=18.8 years) alcohol outcomes. Results:
  We identified five alcohol supply classes: (1) minimal supply (n = 739, 40.8%);
  (2) early parent sips, late peer/parent whole drinks (n = 254, 14.0%); (3) late
  peer/parent whole drinks (n = 419, 23.1%); (4) early parent sips, mid peer/parent
  whole drinks (n = 293, 16.2%); (5) early peer/parent whole drinks (n = 108, 6.0%).
  Compared to minimal supply, the other classes were 2.7–12.9 times as likely to binge
  drink, 1.6–3.0 times as likely to experience alcohol-related harms, and 2.1–8.6
  times as likely to report AUD symptoms at age 19. Conclusion: Earlier supply of
  whole drinks, particularly from peers, was associated with increased risk of early
  adulthood adverse alcohol outcomes. While minimal supply represented the lowest
  risk, supplying sips only in early-mid adolescence and delaying supply of whole
  drinks until late adolescence is likely to be less risky than earlier supply of
  whole drinks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.'
