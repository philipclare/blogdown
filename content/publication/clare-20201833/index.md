abstract: 'Background and Aims: Recent research suggests that parental supply of alcohol
  is associated with more risky drinking and alcohol-related harm among adolescents.
  However, the overall effect of parental supply throughout adolescence remains unclear,
  because parental supply of alcohol varies during adolescence. Due to the complexity
  of longitudinal data, standard analytical methods can be biased. This study examined
  the effect of parental supply of alcohol on alcohol-related outcomes in early adulthood
  using robust methods to minimize risk of bias. Design: Prospective longitudinal
  cohort study. Setting: Australia. Participants: A cohort of school students (n = 1906)
  recruited in the first year of secondary school (average age 12.9 years) from Australian
  schools in 2010–11, interviewed annually for 7 years. Measurements: The exposure
  variable was self-reported parental supply of alcohol (including sips/whole drinks)
  during 5 years of adolescence (waves 1–5). Outcome variables were self-reported
  binge drinking, alcohol-related harm and symptoms of alcohol use disorder, measured
  in the two waves after the exposure period (waves 6–7). To reduce risk of bias,
  we used targeted maximum likelihood estimation to assess the (counterfactual) effect
  of parental supply of alcohol in all five waves versus no supply on alcohol-related
  outcomes. Findings: Parental supply of alcohol throughout adolescence saw greater
  risk of binge drinking [risk ratios (RR) = 1.53; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.27–1.84]
  and alcohol-related harms (RR = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.22–1.69) in the year following
  the exposure period compared with no supply in adolescence. Earlier initiation of
  parental supply also increased risk of binge drinking (RR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.05–1.14),
  and any alcohol-related harm (RR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.05–1.13) for each year earlier
  parental supply began compared with later (or no) initiation. Conclusions: Adolescents
  whose parents supply them with alcohol appear to have an increased risk of alcohol-related
  harm compared with adolescents whose parents do not supply them with alcohol. The
  risk appears to increase with earlier initiation of supply. © 2020 Society for the
