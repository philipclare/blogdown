abstract: 'Objectives: Despite media and public dialog portraying loneliness as a
  worsening problem, little is known about how the prevalence of loneliness has changed
  over time. Our study aims to identify (a) temporal trends in episodic and sustained
  loneliness (lonely in 1 wave vs consistently lonely in 3 consecutive waves); (b)
  trends across sociodemographic subgroups by sex, race/ethnicity, birth cohort, education,
  employment status, marital status, and living alone; and (c) longitudinal predictors
  of loneliness in middle-Aged and older Americans (≥50 years). Methods: Based on
  Waves 3 (1996) to 14 (2018) of the Health and Retirement Study (n = 18,841-23,227),
  we conducted a series of lagged mixed-effects Poisson regression models to assess
  trends of episodic and sustained loneliness in the overall and sociodemographic
  subgroup samples (by sex, race/ethnicity, birth cohort, education, employment, relationship,
  and living alone status). To examine the predictors of episodic and sustained loneliness,
  we used a multivariate mixed-effects Poisson regression model with all sociodemographic
  variables entered into the same model. Results: Episodic loneliness prevalence decreased
  from 20.1% to 15.5% and sustained loneliness from 4.6% to 3.6%. Trends were similar
  across most subgroups. Males, Caucasians, those born in 1928-1945, with university
  education, working, married/partnered, and those not living alone reported lower
  episodic and sustained loneliness, although associations with sustained loneliness
  were stronger. Discussion: Contrary to common perceptions, loneliness has decreased
  over 20 years of follow-up in middle-Aged and older Americans. Several sociodemographic
  subgroups have been identified as having a higher risk of loneliness, prompting
  targeted public health attention.  © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University
