abstract: 'Background and aims: Tolerance to the effects of alcohol is an important
  element in the diagnosis of alcohol use disorders (AUD); however, there is ongoing
  debate about its utility in the diagnosis AUD in adolescents and young adults. This
  study aimed to refine the assessment of tolerance in young adults by testing different
  definitions of tolerance and their associations with longitudinal AUD outcomes.
  Design: Prospective cohort study. Settings: Australia. Participants: A contemporary
  cohort of emerging adults across Australia (n = 565, mean age = 18.9, range = 18–21
  at baseline). Measurements: Clinician-administered Structured Clinical Interview
  for DSM-IV Research Version (SCID-IV-RV) assessed for AUD criteria across five interviews,
  at 6-month intervals over 2.5 years. Tolerance definitions were operationalized
  using survey-type response (yes/no), clinician judgement (SCID-IV-RV), different
  initial drinking quantity and percentage increase thresholds and average heavy consumption
  metrics. AUD persistence was operationalized by the number of times AUD was present
  across the 2.5-year study period (n = 491), and new-onset AUD was operationalized
  as any new incidence of AUD during the follow-up period (n = 461). Findings: The
  (i) SCID-IV-RV clinician judgement [odds ratio (OR) = 2.50, P = 0.005], (ii) an
  initial drinking quantity threshold of four to five drinks and 50% minimum increase
  (OR = 2.48, P = 0.007) and (iii) 50% increase only (OR = 2.40, P = 0.005) were the
  tolerance definitions more strongly associated with any new onset of AUD throughout
  the four follow-up time-points than other definitions. However, these definitions
  were not associated with persistent AUD (Ps > 0.05). Average heavy consumption definitions
  of tolerance were most strongly associated with persistent AUD (OR = 6.66, P = 0.001;
  OR = 4.65, P = 0.004) but not associated with new-onset AUD (Ps > 0.05). Conclusions:
  Initial drink and percentage change thresholds appear to improve the efficacy of
  change-based tolerance as an indicator for new-onset alcohol use disorder diagnosis
  in self-report surveys of young adults. When predicting persistent alcohol use disorder,
  average heavy consumption-based indicators appear to be a better way to measure
  tolerance than self-reported change-based definitions. © 2022 The Authors. Addiction
