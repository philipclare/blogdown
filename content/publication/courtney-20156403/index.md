abstract: 'Background: Smoking cessation research output should move beyond descriptive
  research of the health problem to testing interventions that can provide causal
  data and effective evidence-based solutions. This review examined the number and
  type of published smoking cessation studies conducted in low-socioeconomic status
  (low-SES) and disadvantaged population groups. Methods: A systematic database search
  was conducted for two time periods: 2000–2004 (TP1) and 2008–2012 (TP2). Publications
  that examined smoking cessation in a low-SES or disadvantaged population were coded
  by: population of interest; study type (reviews, non-data based publications, data-based
  publications (descriptive, measurement and intervention research)); and country.
  Intervention studies were coded in accordance with the Cochrane Effective Practice
  and Organisation of Care data collection checklist and use of biochemical verification
  of self-reported abstinence was assessed. Results: 278 citations were included.
  Research output (i.e., all study types) had increased from TP1 27% to TP2 73% (χ²
  = 73.13, p < 0.001), however, the proportion of data-based research had not significantly
  increased from TP1 and TP2: descriptive (TP1 = 23% vs. TP2 = 33%) or intervention
  (TP1 = 77% vs. TP2 = 67%). The proportion of intervention studies adopting biochemical
  verification of self-reported abstinence had significantly decreased from TP1 to
  TP2 with an increased reliance on self-reported abstinence (TP1 = 12% vs. TP2 =
  36%). Conclusions: The current research output is not ideal or optimal to decrease
  smoking rates. Research institutions, scholars and funding organisations should
  take heed to review findings when developing future research and policy. © 2015
