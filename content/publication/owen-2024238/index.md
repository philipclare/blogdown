abstract: 'Background: We aimed to identify long-term patterns of sport participation
  (overall, team, and individual sport) from childhood into adolescence, and to examine
  the association between these patterns and academic outcomes. Methods: This cohort
  study used data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children in wave 3 (4-5
  y) to wave 9 (20-21 y). The participants were a nationally representative sample
  of 4241 children. We conducted latent class analyses to identify sport participation
  trajectories and assessed the association between these trajectories and academic
  outcomes. Results: Continued sport participation was associated with lower odds
  of being absent from school (OR = 0.44; 95% confidence intervals [CIs], 0.26 to
  0.74), better performance on attention (B = -0.010; 95% CIs, -0.019 to -0.002) and
  working memory (B = -0.013; 95% CIs, -0.023 to -0.003), higher numeracy (B = 20.21;
  95% CIs, 14.56 to 25.86) and literacy scores (B = 9.42; 95% CIs, 2.82 to 16.02),
  higher end of school academic performance (B = 3.28; 95% CIs, 1.47 to 5.09), and
  higher odds of studying at university (OR = 1.78; 95% CIs, 1.32 to 2.40). Team sport
  participation was associated with reduced absenteeism, better performance on attention
  and working memory, and being awarded the Higher School Certificate. Whereas individual
  sport participation was associated with higher literacy scores and end of school
  academic performance. Conclusions: Team and individual sport participation both
  benefit academic outcomes, but differently. Given the decline in sport participation
  during adolescence, these findings highlight the need to develop educational policies
  to establish an environment that promotes sport participation, which in turn could
  improve academic outcomes. Â© 2024 Human Kinetics, Inc.'
