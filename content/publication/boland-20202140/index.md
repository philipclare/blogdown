abstract: 'Aims: Despite legal age limits set for alcohol consumption, parents are
  one of the main suppliers of alcohol to underage minors. Although supply from non-parental
  sources has been found to be associated with greater risk of harm compared with
  parental supply, the association between parental supply and supply from other sources
  is unclear. This study investigated the associations between parental supply of
  sips and whole serves of alcohol on subsequent other supply, conditional on current
  supply from non-parental sources. Methods: Data from the Australian Parental Supply
  of Alcohol Longitudinal Study cohort of adolescents was used. A cohort of 1927 Australian
  children recruited in grade 7 (mean age 12.9 years) was surveyed annually from 2010
  to 2016 (94%, n = 1821 included for analyses). The primary outcome was alcohol exposure
  from other sources (‘other supply’), including alcohol supply from other adults,
  friends, siblings, or self-supply, compared with adolescents reporting no supply
  from these sources. Analyses were conducted using random intercept logistic regression
  (to account for within-respondent correlation). Results: Parental supply of alcohol
  alone was associated with increased odds of receiving alcohol from other non-parental
  sources in subsequent years (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.65–2.39) after adjusting for confounders.
  Increased odds of subsequent other supply were associated with current parental
  supply of sips (OR: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.56–2.36) and whole drinks (OR: 2.76; 95% CI:
  1.85–4.11). Conclusions: Parental supply of alcohol appears to increase the risk
  of subsequent supply of alcohol from other sources in certain contexts. © 2020 Society
