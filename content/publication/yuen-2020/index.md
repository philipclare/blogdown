abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Adolescents often display heterogenous trajectories of alcohol
  use. Initiation and escalation of drinking may be important predictors of later
  harms, including alcohol use disorder (AUD). Previous conceptualizations of these
  trajectories lacked adjustment for known confounders of adolescent drinking, which
  we aimed to address by modeling dynamic changes in drinking throughout adolescence
  while adjusting for covariates. METHODS: Survey data from a longitudinal cohort
  of Australian adolescents (n = 1813) were used to model latent class alcohol use
  trajectories over 5 annual follow-ups (mean age = 13.9 until 17.8 years). Regression
  models were used to determine whether child, parent, and peer factors at baseline
  (mean age = 12.9 years) predicted trajectory membership and whether trajectories
  predicted self-reported symptoms of AUD at the final follow-up (mean age = 18.8
  years). RESULTS: We identified 4 classes: abstaining (n = 352); late-onset moderate
  drinking (n = 503); early-onset moderate drinking (n = 663); and early-onset heavy
  drinking (n = 295). Having more alcohol-specific household rules reduced risk of
  early-onset heavy drinking compared with late-onset moderate drinking (relative
  risk ratio: 0.31; 99.5% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11–0.83), whereas having more
  substance-using peers increased this risk (relative risk ratio: 3.43; 99.5% CI:
  2.10–5.62). Early-onset heavy drinking increased odds of meeting criteria for AUD
  in early adulthood (odds ratio: 7.68; 99.5% CI: 2.41–24.47). CONCLUSIONS: Our study
  provides evidence that parenting factors and peer influences in early adolescence
  should be considered to reduce risk of later alcohol-related harm. Early initiation
  and heavy alcohol use throughout adolescence are associated with increased risk
  of alcohol-related harm compared with recommended maximum levels of consumption
  (late-onset, moderate drinking). Copyright © 2020 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.'
