abstract: "Aims: Vigorous physical activity (VPA) is a time-efficient way to achieve
  recommended physical activity levels. There is a very limited understanding of the
  minimal and optimal amounts of vigorous physical activity in relation to mortality
  and disease incidence. Methods and results: A prospective study in 71 893 adults
  [median age (IQR): 62.5 years (55.3, 67.7); 55.9% female] from the UK Biobank cohort
  with wrist-worn accelerometry. VPA volume (min/week) and frequency of short VPA
  bouts (≤2 min) were measured. The dose-response associations of VPA volume and frequency
  with mortality [all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer], and CVD and
  cancer incidence were examined after excluding events occurring in the first year.
  During a mean post-landmark point follow-up of 5.9 years (SD ± 0.8), the adjusted
  5-year absolute mortality risk was 4.17% (95% confidence interval: 3.19%, 5.13%)
  for no VPA, 2.12% (1.81%, 2.44%) for >0 to <10 min, 1.78% (1.53%, 2.03%) for 10
  to <30 min, 1.47% (1.21%, 1.73%) for 30 to <60 min, and 1.10% (0.84%, 1.36%) for
  ≥60 min. The 'optimal dose' (nadir of the curve) was 53.6 (50.5, 56.7) min/week
  [hazard ratio (HR): 0.64 (0.54, 0.77)] relative to the 5th percentile reference
  (2.2 min/week). There was an inverse linear dose-response association of VPA with
  CVD mortality. The 'minimal' volume dose (50% of the optimal dose) was ∼15 (14.3,
  16.3) min/week for all-cause [HR: 0.82 (0.75, 0.89)] and cancer [HR: 0.84 (0.74,
  0.95)] mortality, and 19.2 (16.5, 21.9) min/week [HR: 0.60 (0.50, 0.72)] for CVD
  mortality. These associations were consistent for CVD and cancer incidence. There
  was an inverse linear association between VPA frequency and CVD mortality. 27 (24,
  30) bouts/week was associated with the lowest all-cause mortality [HR: 0.73 (0.62,
  0.87)]. Conclusion: VPA of 15-20 min/week were associated with a 16-40% lower mortality
  HR, with further decreases up to 50-57 min/week. These findings suggest reduced
  health risks may be attainable through relatively modest amounts of VPA accrued
  in short bouts across the week. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University
