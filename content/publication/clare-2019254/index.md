abstract: 'Background Obtaining unbiased causal estimates from longitudinal observational
  data can be difficult due to exposure-affected time-varying confounding. The past
  decade has seen considerable development in methods for analysing such complex longitudinal
  data. However, the extent to which those methods have been implemented is unclear.
  This study describes and characterizes the state of the field in methods adjusting
  for exposure-affected time-varying confounding, and examines their use in the literature.
  Methods We systematically reviewed the literature from 2000 to 2016 for studies
  adjusting for time-dependent confounding, including use of specific methods like
  inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Articles were coded based on
  the methods used and, for applied articles, the topic areas covered. Results We
  screened 4239 abstracts, and subsequently reviewed 1100 articles, leaving 542 relevant
  articles in the analyses. The number of published articles increased from two in
  2000, to 112 in 2016. This increase was primarily in applied articles using IPTW,
  which increased from one study in 2000, to 90 in 2016. Of the 432 studies with applications
  to observed data, 60.9% were on at least one of: HIV (30.6%), cardiopulmonary health
  (13.2%), kidney disease (11.8%) or mental health (10.0%). Conclusions There has
  been marked growth in reports addressing exposure-affected time-varying confounding.
  This was driven by work in a small number of topic areas, with other areas showing
  relatively little uptake. In addition, despite developments in more advanced methods
  such doubly robust techniques and estimation via machine learning, implementation
  has been largely concentrated on the simpler, yet potentially less robust, IPTW.
