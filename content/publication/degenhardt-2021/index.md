abstract: 'Importance: Despite concern about harms related to long-term prescribed
  opioid use among individuals with chronic noncancer pain (CNCP), no study has examined
  whether the same patients engage in a risky pattern of use consistently for the
  long term. Objective: To examine the prevalence, incidence, persistence, and cessation
  of a range of opioid behaviors, indicators of extramedical use, and harm among individuals
  who are prescribed opioids. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 5-year prospective
  cohort study in communities across Australia included 1514 adults who were prescribed
  opioids for CNCP. Data collection took place from August 2012 to December 2018,
  and data analysis took place from February to November 2020. Exposure: Prescription
  opioid use. Main Outcomes and Measures: High-dose opioid use (≥200 oral morphine
  equivalent [OME] mg/d); requesting an increase in opioid dose; requesting an early
  prescription renewal; tampering with opioid medication; diversion of medication
  to others; and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
  Health Problems, Tenth Revision opioid dependence. Cessation of opioid use was also
  assessed. Results: Of the 1514 participants, 672 (44.39%) were men, the mean (SD)
  age was 58 (19) years, and 737 (48.68%) were unemployed. At each annual interview,
  approximately 1 in 8 people (10.98% [95% CI, 10.33%-11.63%] to 14.73% [95% CI, 13.98%-15.48%]
  at any given interview) were taking more than 200 OME mg/d; comparatively more had
  requested an increased dosage in the previous 3 months (8.46% [95% CI, 7.89%-9.03%]
  to 23.77% [95% CI, 22.82%-24.73%]); and fewer asked for an early prescription renewal
  (4.61% [95% CI, 4.19%-5.03%] to 13.97% [95% CI, 13.24%-14.70%]). In any given interview,
  between 3.06% (95% CI, 2.72%-3.40%) and 7.86% (95% CI, 7.31%-8.41%) of respondents
  reported tampering and between 0.47% (95% CI, 0.33%-0.60%) and 1.39% (95% CI, 1.16%-1.62%)
  reported diversion to others. Between 8.28% (95% CI, 7.71%-8.84%) and 13.06% (95%
  CI, 12.35%-13.77%) met criteria for opioid dependence at each interview. Opioid
  cessation increased across interviews, from year 1 (9.15% [95% CI, 8.55%-9.74%])
  to year 5 (20.02% [19.14%-20.89%]). There was considerable incidence and cessation
  in all behaviors from 1 interview to the next: most who engaged in any of these
  behaviors only did so at only 1 interview. For pharmaceutical opioid dependence,
  between 55.26% (95% CI, 53.81%-56.71%) and 64.44% (95% CI, 62.87%-66.00%) of cases
  in 1 interview did not meet dependence criteria in the following interview. Conclusions
  and Relevance: These findings suggest considerable fluidity in opioid use, extramedical
  behaviors, and opioid dependence among people with CNCP. This reinforces the need
  for reassessment of the effectiveness and safety of prescription opioid use over
  time. © 2021 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.'
