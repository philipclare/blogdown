abstract: 'Introduction and Aims: Needle-syringe programs (NSP) are an underutilized
  source of data on drug injection trends; these data are essential for informing
  public health interventions. We examine trends in NSP service occasions from 2007–2015.
  Design and Methods: Using standardised data from 26 NSP outlets through the Queensland
  NSP Minimum Data Set (QNSPMDS), trends in service occasions among clients intending
  to inject methamphetamine, heroin, opioid substitution therapy (OST) medications
  and other pharmaceutical opioids were assessed using multilevel mixed-effects negative
  binomial regression, adjusting for month, year, age and clustering by site. Results:
  Over 1.5 million service occasions were recorded in 2007–2015. Methamphetamine was
  the main ‘drug intended to inject’ (33.7%), however cf. 2007, the incidence rate
  ratio decreased to 0.64 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.66) in 2009, remaining low until 2015.
  Among clients reporting methamphetamine injection, there was a shift in the form
  from base to the higher-potency crystal methamphetamine since 2012. Heroin injection
  (22.5% service occasions) initially increased (cf. 2007), followed by a decline
  to 0.77 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.79) in 2015. Significant and sustained increases in OST
  and other pharmaceutical opioids injection were observed throughout the study period,
  accounting for 7.2% and 19.8% of total visits, respectively. Discussion and Conclusions:
  The QNSPMDS provides unique, routinely collected, jurisdiction-wide and standardised
  data on the demographics of people who inject drugs, types of drugs injected and
  regional variations; these data are essential in informing policy, planning and
  program implementation. There remains significant opportunity to enhance engagement
  and linkage to care alongside needle-syringe provision. © 2019 Australasian Professional
