abstract: 'Background and aims: Experience of alcohol-induced memory blackouts in
  adolescence may be an important risk factor for later harms. This longitudinal study
  (i) modelled trajectories of alcohol-related blackouts throughout adolescence, (ii)
  explored early-adolescent predictors of blackout trajectories and (iii) examined
  the association between blackout trajectories and alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptoms.
  Design: Longitudinal study in which data from six annual surveys of a longitudinal
  cohort of Australian adolescents were used to model latent class growth trajectories
  of blackouts, adjusting for alcohol consumption frequency and typical quantity.
  Regression models were used to determine whether parent, child and peer factors
  at baseline (mean age = 12.9) predicted profiles of blackout trajectory membership
  and whether blackout trajectories predicted meeting criteria for AUD in early adulthood
  (mean age = 19.8). Setting and participants: Australian adolescents (n = 1821; mean
  age = 13.9–18.8 years). Measurements: Alcohol-related blackouts, alcohol consumption
  frequency, typical consumption quantity and DSM-5 AUD in early adulthood were all
  self-reported. Findings: We identified a three-class solution: delayed alcohol initiation,
  rare blackouts (n = 701; 38.5%); early initiation, rare blackouts (n = 869; 47.7%);
  and early initiation, increasing blackouts (n = 251; 13.8%). Female sex was associated
  with increased risk of early initiation, increasing blackouts relative to delayed
  initiation, rare blackouts [relative risk ratio (RRR) = 3.90; 99.5% confidence interval
  (CI) = 1.96, 7.76] and relative to early initiation, rare blackouts (RRR = 2.89;
  99.5% CI = 1.42, 5.87). Early initiation, rare blackouts [odds ratio (OR) = 1.96;
  99.5% CI = 1.17, 3.29] and early initiation, increasing blackouts (OR = 4.93; 99.5%
  CI = 2.32, 10.48) were each associated with increased odds of meeting criteria for
  AUD in early adulthood relative to delayed initiation, rare blackouts. Early initiation,
  increasing blackouts was associated with increased odds of meeting criteria for
  AUD in early adulthood relative to early initiation, rare blackouts (OR = 2.51;
  99.5% CI = 1.18, 5.38). Conclusions: Females in Australia appear to be at higher
  risk of adolescent alcohol-related blackouts independent of alcohol consumption
  levels and age of initiation. Alcohol-related blackouts may be associated with later
  alcohol use disorder. © 2021 Society for the Study of Addiction'
