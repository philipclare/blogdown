title: A Whirlwind Tour of Alternative Study Designs
abstract: "While most public health researchers are familiar with randomised controlled trials and survey studies, there are a range of other study designs that are less familiar, but which have the potential to answer research questions that might be difficult or impossible with an RCT or survey design.
This seminar will provide an overview of a range of different study designs that can be used in medical and public health research, comparing them to standard designs, and describing their strengths and weaknesses."
