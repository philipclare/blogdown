My personal research, which began with my PhD, is on the use of causal inference in longitudinal observational data.

To date, I have published a systematic review of the use of causal inference methods in addressing the issue of exposure-affected time-varying confounding. I also have a number of other papers currently under review, for which the code is available on my website. This includes a tutorial on the use of targeted maximum likelihood estimation in longitudinal data analysis.
