# Overview

1. Introduction
1. ‘Standard’ designs
1. Experimental Study Designs
1. Descriptive Study Designs
1. Other designs
1. Conclusions

---

# 1. Introduction

- Descriptive vs experimental
- Most important thing is to use the best design for the specific question being asked

---

# 1. Introduction

- Descriptive studies:
  - Involve observing and assessing
  - Can be used for things where it isn’t ethical to randomise
- Experimental studies:
  - Involve the researchers changing something
  - Tend to be more difficult and expensive

---
class: red-section

# 2. 'Standard' Designs

---

# 2. 'Standard' Designs

- Three standard designs we should all know:
  - Randomised controlled trials
  - Cross-sectional surveys
  - Longitudinal surveys
- These tend to form the standard by which other study designs are considered
  - eg how is a particular design better or worse than an RCT

---

# 2. 'Standard' Designs

Randomised Controlled Trials
- Randomise to group; give each group a different intervention; follow-up and compare the groups
- Gold standard for causation
  - Ignorability
- Efficacy vs Effectiveness
- Not always appropriate

---

Randomised Controlled Trials

---

# 2. 'Standard' Designs

Cross-sectional survey
- Tends to be exploratory
  - Hard to design an RCT when you don’t know what the intervention should be
- Can be cheap and easy to design, run, analyse and report
- Difficult to recruit representative samples

---

# 2. 'Standard' Designs

Prospective Cohort
- In some ways, just an extension of cross-sectional
  - But there are a range of specific issues that arise in longitudinal research that do not apply in cross-sectional research
  - There are also specific benefits
- Can be either descriptive or analytic
- With limitations, can be used for causal inference

# 3. Experimental Designs

---

# 3. Experimental Designs

- There are lots of other experimental designs:
  - Pre/post experimental trials
  - Cluster RCTs
  - Stepped-wedge
  - Cross-over Trials

---

# 3. Experimental Designs

Pre/post Designs
- Measure participants, then administer intervention and measure again
- Participants form their own control
- Within subjects designs reduces variance, so requires smaller sample sizes
- Don’t know what would have happened without the experiment

---

# 3. Experimental Designs

Pre/post Designs

.center[
![Pre/post Designs](assets/fig4.png)
]

---

# 3. Experimental Designs

Cluster RCTs (1)
- Instead of randomisation at the individual level, randomises at the cluster eg hospital, school
- Good for systemic interventions eg new hospital process
- Also good for interventions where there is risk of cross-contamination eg participants talking to each other while in hospital

---

# 3. Experimental Designs

Cluster RCTs

.center[
![Cluster RCTs](assets/fig5.png)
]

---

# 3. Experimental Designs

Stepped Wedge (2)
- Instead of randomising clusters to intervention or control, randomises the order that intervention begins
- Eventually rolls out to all clusters
- Pragmatic design – not great for efficacy trials

---

# 3. Experimental Designs

Stepped Wedge

.center[

---

# 3. Experimental Designs

Cross-over Trials (3)
- Randomise to order; give participants intervention; wait for effect to fade; give participants intervention they didn’t receive in the first round
- Very good for experiments with multiple, short-acting interventions
- Similar benefit to pre/post – ppnts form their own control
- Allows for testing of multiple interventions

---

# 3. Experimental Designs

Cross-over Trials

class: red-section

# 4. Non-experimental Designs

---

# 4. Non-experimental Designs

- These include:
  - Qualitative studies
  - Case studies
  - Case-control studies
  - Ecological studies

---

# 4. Non-experimental Designs

Qualitative Studies
- Very in-depth
- Great for explaining WHY something happens
- Don't generalise (and aren't intended to)

---

# 4. Non-experimental Designs

Case Studies (4)
- In-depth
- Illustrative, rather than representative

---

# 4. Non-experimental Designs

Case-control Studies (5)
- Find ‘cases’ (ie people where the outcome has occurred), then see how they differ from others in whom the outcome did not occur
- Good for rare outcomes that might not be expected to occur in a prospective study
- Can be unreliable – relies on data that has already been collected

---

# 4. Non-experimental Designs

Case-control Studies

.center[
![Case-control Studies](assets/fig8.png)
]

---

# 4. Non-experimental Designs

Ecological Studies (6)
- Defined by the 'level' of measurement
  - Namely, measurement is at a macro rather than individual level
- Can be used to measure very rare diseases etc
- Can lead to the 'ecological fallacy'
  - Where the nature of the group is falsely used to describe the nature of individuals in the group

# 5. Other Designs

Interrupted Time Series (7)
- Measures the change in a trend that is ‘interrupted’
- Technically involves an intervention – but often out of the researchers hands
- Sometimes the only way to assess whether high-level interventions have any effect.
- Can be problematic because effects often aren't instant

---

---

# 5. Other Designs

Linkage Studies (8)
- Can be either descriptive or experimental
- Can involve linking administrative data to an existing study such as a cohort study, or linking different administrative datasets to each other
- Can be very complex, and involve extremely large datasets

---

# 6. Conclusions

- There are lots of study designs that can be used
- Most important thing is to use the best design for the specific question being asked
