# 1. APSALS Cohort

- Longitudinal project assessing parental and other sources of supply
- Controlling for the known predictors of adolescent drinking
- 1927 adolescent/parent dyads recruited in NSW, TAS, WA  in September 2010
- First captured in Grade 7 aged ~13 years
- From 49 schools (government - 39%, independent - 49%, catholic - 12%)
- Adolescent sex - 45% female
- Assessed annually on-line or paper
- Parents surveyed until Wave 5

# 2. Background

---

# 2. Background

- Mixed hypotheses about impact on alcohol
    - Possible declines due to restrictions. 
    - Possible increases due to financial/psychological distress, known risk factors of alcohol consumption
- Concern about potential negative impacts on mental health
    - Cross-sectional studies show elevated depression, anxiety and stress amongst young adults during the pandemic
    - However, little longitudinal research, and most of it from the USA

# 3. This study

# 3. This study

- Extra survey conducted in mid 2020, in addition to the main APSALS study waves.

# 3. This study

- All participants who had completed APSALS Wave 10 up to April 30 (n=813) and had providewere invited to participate
- n=443 participants completed the COVID survey (54% response rate; 23% of the total sample).

# 3. This study

- Survey included a range of questions from the regular survey, adjusted to ‘past month’ rather than ‘past year’
   - Alcohol use
   - Alcohol-related harm
   - Mental Health
   - Use of mental health/addiction services
- Also included questions about their experiences during the pandemic/lockdown

# 4. Results - Sample

.center[
![Sample characteristics](assets/fig3.png)]

---

# 4. Results – Experience during restrictions

- There was relatively little concern about the COVID-19 disease itself
  - 17% of the sample said they were at least moderately worried about contracting the disease
- This is perhaps unsurprising – at the time of the survey:
  - only 6% of the sample had been tested for COVID-19
  - only 1 respondent had received a positive COVID-19 test result, and had fully recovered.

---

# 4. Results – Experience during restrictions

- Secondary impacts of the pandemic were more common
  - 74% reported they had been or were currently in voluntary isolation
  - The use of precautions were common

# 4. Results – Experience during restrictions

- Housing difficulties were relatively rare
  - &lt;5% had housing difficulties
  - 10% of the sample had moved in with family or their partner
- 20% of the sample reported financial stress

# 5. Conclusions

---

# 5. Conclusions

- Alcohol consumption declined, continuing a trend that began before the pandemic
  - This appeared driven by quantity, with no change in frequency of alcohol consumption, but declines in typical quantity consumed, and binge drinking
  - Unsurprisingly, there was a sharp decline in drinking with others in person, but this was large matched by increases in drinking with others virtually and drinking alone
- There was a decline in the rate of alcohol-related harms
  - These may be related, as drinking at home is likely to reduce the risk of acute harms such as traffic accidents and fighting

  
---

# 5. Conclusions

- Increases in depression and anxiety symptoms
- Changes were less severe than in some other countries
  - Possibly due to the relatively low impact of COVID-19 in Australia
- No change in help seeking
  - While the Australian Government introduced initiatives to improve access to mental health support, there may have been a lag in uptake, and barriers such as cost may have remained
- Results for both alcohol and mental health were consistent by gender
  - Although women generally showed higher rates of depression/anxiety, there was no gender difference in change due to the restrictions

---

# 5. Strengths and Weaknesses

- One of the few studies investigating impact of COVID-19 prospectively
- Self-selected sample &gt; but similar to population
- Only covered relatively ‘early’ stages of the pandemic – May-June 2020
- May not generalize beyond the Australian context
- Mental health was self-report not clinical interview
